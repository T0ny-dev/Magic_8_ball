<p style="font-size:18px;">It's a simple JS project that emulates a classic Magic Ball 8 game. <br><br> Where you answer with a simple answer , for example "No", "Yes", "Probably" is fun.<br><br>
to play, you think of a question and click on the ball, in a moment it shows a message with your answer</p>

## Goodluck 
> to edit the responses you can go to js/main.js and change the response of the magicBall function
